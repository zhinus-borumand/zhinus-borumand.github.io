    <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
    
    <h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
    <p>HTML gives the basic structure of a website, which can then be enhanced with CSS to give it a better appearance, and also enhanced
      with JavaScript to make it more interactive. To use an analogy, imagine a bag. HTML would be the fabric and seams that give the 
      bag its bag-structure, like a sack. CSS would be the colour of the bag and any patches, pins, or other decorations that make the
      bag look good. And JavaScript would be the zippers, and pockets, and strap adjusters, and handles and all the other features of 
      a bag that someone can hold onto, open or close, add things to, take things out of, or otherwise manipulate. </p>

    <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
    <p>Control flow is basically the order in which the computer runs the code. This is normally from the first line at the top down
      to the last line at the end, UNLESS there is something in the code that changes the control flow, like a loop. A loop is a sequence
      of code that will repeat itself (i.e. loop) over and over again for the specified number of times. 
    </p>

    <h4>The DOM</h4>
    <p>The DOM stands for the Document Object Model. This is what the browser creates when a webpage is loaded. This model is basically
      like a tree made out of objects, with each "branch" ending in a node that contains an object or objects, like so:

    </p>
    <p>The DOM lets you use JavaScript to access all the elements in a webpage. You can change, remove, or add elements and attributes
      however you choose using JavaScript. You can also notify the code of events, or instances when a user has interacted with the webpage
      in some way (e.g. with a mouse click, or pressing a key), through event handlers. Another way you might interact with the DOM is by
      using Developer Tools (aka DevTools) to examine the code of webpage or run a test. Rather than directly creating a webpage, you can use DevTools
      to manipulate the DOM in order to test something out or debug your code.

    <h4>Arrays vs Objects</h4>
    <p>The difference between accessing data from an array versus accessing data from an object is</p>
