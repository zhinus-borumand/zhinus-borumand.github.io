    <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
    
    <h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
    <p>HTML gives the basic structure of a website, which can then be enhanced with CSS to give it a better appearance, and also enhanced
      with JavaScript to make it more interactive. To use an analogy, imagine a bag. HTML would be the fabric and seams that give the 
      bag its bag-structure, like a sack. CSS would be the colour of the bag and any patches, pins, or other decorations that make the
      bag look good. And JavaScript would be the zippers, and pockets, and strap adjusters, and handles and all the other features of 
      a bag that someone can hold onto, open or close, add things to, take things out of, or otherwise manipulate. </p>

    <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
    <p>Control flow is basically the order in which the computer runs the code. This is normally from the first line at the top down
      to the last line at the end, UNLESS there is something in the code that changes the control flow, like a loop. A loop is a sequence
      of code that will repeat itself (i.e. loop) over and over again for the specified number of times. Here's an example process from everyday
      life - control flow would be the order in which someone with long hair might make a basic cup of tea: boil water > pour boiled water
      into cup > add teabag > add a teaspoon of sugar > and then drink. But if you know you wanted your tea super sweet, you would have a 
      loop BEFORE the end where you drink the tea, where you loop back and repeat the action of adding a teaspoon of sugar until you've
      reached the desired amount (let's say 3 teaspoons), so the process with the loop would look like this: boil water > pour boiled water
      into cup > add teabag > add a teaspoon of sugar (first iteration) > add a teaspoon of sugar (second iteration) > add a teaspoon of sugar 
      (third iteration) > that's enough sugar! > and then drink.
      
    </p>

    <h4>The DOM</h4>
    <p>The DOM stands for the Document Object Model. This is what the browser creates when a webpage is loaded. This model is basically
      like a tree made out of objects, with each "branch" ending in a node that contains an object or objects, like so: 
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>The DOM lets you use JavaScript to access all the elements in a webpage. You can change, remove, or add elements and attributes
      however you choose using JavaScript. You can also notify the code of events, or instances when a user has interacted with the webpage
      in some way (e.g. with a mouse click, or pressing a key), through event handlers. Another way you might interact with the DOM is by
      using Developer Tools (aka DevTools) to examine the code of webpage or run a test. Rather than directly creating a webpage, you can use DevTools
      to manipulate the DOM in order to test something out or debug your code.  
    </p>

    <h4>Arrays vs Objects</h4>
    <p>Both arrays and objects can contain data. But there is a difference between accessing data from an array versus accessing data from an 
      object. An array is basically like a conveyor belt that has a number of items on it, and each item on the conveyor belt has an index value 
      in ascending order beginning from [0]. To access an item, you can write the name of the array, followed by the item's index value in 
      square brackets. The picture below shows what has been accessed from the array in the console on the right hand side: 
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>  
      An object contains key-value pairs called properties. In the example below, 'one', 'two', and 'three' are the keys, and each are followed
      by their value ("item one", "item two", "item three" correspondingly). 
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      You  can access a property from an object using the object.key format. The picture above shows in the console on the right hand side 
      that object.two will access the value "item two".
    </p>

    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>A function is a block of code that will execute a task that it has been design to do. It will run only if it has been invoked, or "called". 
      The function enables you to design or write out a task once, and then call it any number times later on in the code wherever it is needed, 
      removing the need to write out the whole block of code for a task more than once. Below is an example of a basic function that will
      log the string "Hello world!" in the console on the right hand side when the function hello() is called. 
    </p>
