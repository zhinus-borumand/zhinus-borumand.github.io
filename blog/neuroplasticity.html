        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h4>How does understanding neuroplasticity help people?</h4>
        <p>Understanding neuroplasticity, that the brain is malleable rather than fixed and unchangeable, can help people become motivated to learn new things. It can also help motivate people to become encouraged to practise what they've learned to strengthen neural connections, thereby forming good habits in their learning journey.</p>

        <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>
        <p>I will incorporate a daily habit of reviewing over the material which I have learned that day, even if it's for a short time. I will also practice, practice, practice what I have learned. </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>Some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity include: practising mindfulness, exercising, breaking from routine in small ways, learning a new language, learning a new musical instrument, traveling, cooking new foods, and listening to different kinds of music.</p>

        <h4>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h4>
        <p>Growth mindset is the mindset that a person's abilities, intelligence, and talents are not fixed, but are capable of growth when one works towards it. It is relevant because it is an important mindset to have for any learning journey. Because obstacles and road bumps are inevitable when learning something new, it is important to have a growth mindset so that you're not discouraged from continuing when you perform poorly.</p>

        <h4>Did anything surprise you or change for you after this exploration about growth mindset?</h4>
        <p>I was surprised that breaking from your routine in small ways can help increase neuroplasticity. Not surprised that it works, but surprised that it is something that can be easily incorporated into your life, such as brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand, shopping for groceries from a different store than usual, dressing with your eyes closed, etc.</p>

        <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
        <p>When I encounter a difficult problem in my learning journey, I will not view it as an indicator of my own inadequacy, rather I will try to view it as an opportunity to grow my problem-solving skills.</p>

        <h4>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging. </h4>
        <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article by Carol Dweck about a few misconceptions about growth mindset that may be interesting to read.</p>

        <h4>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </h4>
        <p>I will try to intentionally counter the negative thoughts in my mind with the thought that each day I have learned something and know more than I did yesterday, so that I maintain the awareness that I HAVE been growing, and therefore my abilities are not fixed. </p>
