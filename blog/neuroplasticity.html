        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h4>How does understanding neuroplasticity help people?</h4>
        <p>Understanding neuroplasticity, that the brain is malleable rather than fixed and unchangeable, can help people become motivated to learn new things. It can also help motivate people to become encouraged to practise what they've learned to strengthen neural connections, thereby forming good habits in their learning journey.</p>

        <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>
        <p>I will incorporate a daily habit of reviewing over the material which I have learned that day, even if it's for a short time. I will also practice, practice, practice what I have learned. </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>Some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity include: practising mindfulness, exercising, breaking from routine in small ways, learning a new language, learning a new musical instrument, traveling, cooking new foods, and listening to different kinds of music.</p>
