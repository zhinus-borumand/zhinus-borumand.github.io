        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

        <h4>What's a time when you were blocked on a simple problem?</h4>
        <p>
          For the deBee function in the Built-in Methods kata exercise, I couldn't figure out how to implement the toLowerCase() method in a way that would let me filter out the buzz words without making the whole array of strings into lower case as well. I tried googling for ways to change a string in a way that would recognise that string in whatever way it was originally capitalised. Then I did some trial and error. Then I searched through discord to see if previous messages on there from my peers could help, and I saw someone who had had the same problem but figured it out on their own - they said they had put the method in the wrong place. This made everything in my mind fall into place and finally made me realise that the solution was actually quite simple. I was mostly feeling curious throughout my searching and trial and error. I knew it must be a relatively simple thing and so I would eventually get it, it was just a matter of how long it would take me... I learned that sometimes I can overcomplicate a problem, and it may be best to try something simple rather than overthink it. 
        </p>

        <h4>What's a time when you elegantly solved a problem?</h4>
        <p>
          I don't think I would call it elegant, but a time when I solved a problem with relative ease was for the capitalize function in the Built-in Methods kata exercise. I remembered from previous course material that there was a way to get the acronym of several words which involved a method that allows you to select the first character of a word, so I searched back for it and used it solve the problem of capitalising the first letter. I also used the problem-solving technique of looking at the hints! (Which I think counts under "asking coaches for help".) Because I needed a way to join the non-capitalised characters to the first capitalised letter, and the hints mentioned a method which I searched up which elegantly solved that problem. I felt quite satisfied throughout the process. I learned that I can sometimes find solutions in the material that I've already been through in the past, rather than ONLY looking for something I haven't done before.

        <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
        <p>
          Pseudocode: Pretty confident, this is an easy technique to do, and it helps to focus the mind before you start working on the problem. <br>
          Trying something: Also quite confident, this is usually one of the techniques I use the most when problem-solving, trial-and-error. <br>
          Rubber ducky method: I haven't tried this a lot, maybe only a couple of times. I feel like I do this in my head when I'm stuck on something anyway so I think I'm confident with it, but I will try this out-loud more often. <br>
          Reading error messages: Very confident, this is an easy one to do and it's the first thing I look at when something goes wrong. <br>
          Console.logging: Also very confident, I do this a lot, every time I try something out I will be console.logging it. <br>
          Googling: Again quite confident, this along with 'trying something' is one of the techniques I use the most and it is usually helpful. <br>
          Asking your peers/coaches for help: Somewhat less confident than the other methods, mostly because I'm shy. I also have less experience with this than I do with other methods, also because I'm on a later sprint schedule than my peers, if I'm stuck on something, someone before me has already asked about it and there's already help in a thread on discord. 
          Improving your process with reflection: Also relatively less confident, because I have less practice with this than I do with googling something or trial-and-error. But I would like to get more confident in it. <br>
