        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

        <h4>1)    What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          I'm hoping to use the skills I gain during this course for a career in software development. I would like to continually develop my skills and knowledge after finishing this course and throughout my career both for personal satisfaction and for advancement. 
        </p>

        <h4>2)   What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>
          I took the VIA Character Strengths Finder Survey again and according to the results my top strength is still humility (which feels weird to write). I think this can be useful when engaging in teamwork and keep me grounded in terms of setting realistic goals for Bootcamp. My next strength in the list is love of learning, which I think will definitely help me when I encounter obstacles during Bootcamp. My limitations are anxiety and fear of failure, which can hinder me from moving forward in a task, but keeping that strength in mind can help me refocus and redirect my thoughts towards the learning aspect rather than the result aspect when I have to grapple with these limitations. 
        </p>

        <h4>3)    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
        <p>
          I think my biggest non-technical challenges may be staying on top of the material and speaking up when I need help. 
        </p>

        <h4>4)    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          What I wrote in the earlier learning plan remains true - I would like to continue to develop my communication skills as well as skills in managing or lowering anxiety. I would also like to continue in developing skills in mindfulness, time management, self-discipline, problem-solving, self-confidence, leadership, and basically any and all the human skills that are available in the Dev Academy course. <br> 
          And in addition I would also like to develop my self-awareness and reflective skills. 
        </p>

        <h4>5)    What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          Patience, support, and encouragement when anxiety seems high. Encouragement to ask questions or ask for help, and provide help. Providing actionable feedback on what I can improve on.
        </p>

        <h4>6)    What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>
          I will set goals for what I need to accomplish for the day, based on the learning competencies. If I'm stuck on something and need help I will ask the facilitators. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I will take a step back from the work, take a short break to clear my mind, and do some breathing exercises to relieve stress. 
        </p>

        <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>

        <h4>1)    What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to build a career as a software developer. Ideally, I would like to have a job with work-life balance, the option to work from home, opportunities for skill development, and upward mobility.
        </p>

        <h4>2)   A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>
          My strengths include my curiosity and love of learning, and my limitations includes difficulty in focusing and a fear of failure. 
        </p>

        <h4>3)    What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my communication skills (both written and verbal), and especially skills in managing or lowering anxiety. Skills in mindfulness, time management, self-discipline, problem-solving, self-confidence, leadership, and basically any and all the human skills that are available in the Dev Academy course.
        </p>

        <h4>4)    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
        <p>
           - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
          Implementing a small reward system for staying on task (e.g. a sweet snack after working diligently for an hour) <br>
          Starting the day with clear tasks / goals, and not going to bed until I have finished the task or met the goal<br>
          Asking for help if stuck on something for more than 15 min <br>
          Communicating with facilitators if I believe I won’t meet a deadline<br>
           - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br>
          Make sure I am getting enough sleep<br>
          Take a breather by going for a short walk. Make sure to get 20 min of outdoor time in the sun each day. <br>
          Do a stress-relieving breathing exercise 
        </p>

        <h4>5)    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>
          I will ask for help on discord if stuck on something for more than 15 min, no matter how dumb I think my question is. Discord is where fear of judgement goes to die!
        </p>

        <h4>6)    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          A lot of patience please, and to be supportive and encouraging. To give advice for areas of improvement.
        </p>

        <h4>7)    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to commit a couple of hours for daily chores and cooking meals. Plus some time in the evenings to spend with family. Ideally, have some more free time in one of the weekend days.
        </p>
