        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

        <h4>1)    What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>My long term goal is to build a career as a software developer. Ideally, I would like to have a job with work-life balance, the option to work from home, opportunities for skill development, and upward mobility.</p>

        <h4> 2)   A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>My strengths include my curiosity and love of learning, and my limitations includes difficulty in focusing and a fear of failure. </p>

        <h4>3)    What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>I would like to develop my communication skills (both written and verbal), and especially skills in managing or lowering anxiety. Skills in mindfulness, time management, self-discipline, problem-solving, self-confidence, leadership, and basically any and all the human skills that are available in the Dev Academy course.</p>

        <h4>4)    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
        <p> - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</p>
        <p>Implementing a small reward system for staying on task (e.g. a sweet snack after working diligently for an hour) </p>
        <p>Starting the day with clear tasks / goals, and not going to bed until I have finished the task or met the goal</p>
        <p>Asking for help if stuck on something for more than 15 min </p>
        <p>Communicating with facilitators if I believe I won’t meet a deadline</p>
        <p> - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
        <p>Make sure I am getting enough sleep</p>
        <p>Take a breather by going for a short walk. Make sure to get 20 min of outdoor time in the sun each day. </p>
        <p>Do a stress-relieving breathing exercise </p>

        <h4>5)    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>I will ask for help on discord if stuck on something for more than 15 min, no matter how dumb I think my question is. Discord is where fear of judgement goes to die!</p>

        <h4> 6)   A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>A lot of patience please, and to be supportive and encouraging. To give advice for areas of improvement.</p>

        <h4> 7)   Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>I would like to commit a couple of hours for daily chores and cooking meals. Plus some time in the evenings to spend with family. Ideally, have some more free time in one of the weekend days.</p>
